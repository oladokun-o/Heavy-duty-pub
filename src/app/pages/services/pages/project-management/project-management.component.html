          <article class="fs-6" style="line-height: 25px;">
            One major root cause of contract failures is weak or total lack of project management skills.
            Many contractors alike are usually overwhelmed by all the aspects of the job they are trying to execute.
            The inability to manage the usually lean resources and sourcing efficient material suppliers eventually
            causes the jobs to end up incurring more costs or outright abandon and in some cases compromise. We
            have been there too.
